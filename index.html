<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 18px; color: navy">This website is going to be my general musings, thoughts and a little about myself.</p>
<h3 style="color: navy;"> <u> It's all about me </u></h3> 
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: navy">After graduating from the <a href:"http://www.lse.ac.uk>LSE </a> in 2008, I did a variety of internships and jobs, from Investment Banking to working for a global e-commerce incubator in Malaysia.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; color: navy"> My dream was always to start my own business, so together, myself and my co-founder launched <a href:"http://www.mybluetasks.com>  <b>mybluetasks</b> <a/> - an instant booking system for all household services.
